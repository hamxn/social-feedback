1. The Citizen sends a report
2. The Department of Health received and process the report
3. The Department of Health update status for the report at process state.
4. The Citizen can verify the process state.
5. The Ministry of Health can verify all of the process.

#  Running the Application (development mode)
Follow these steps to setup and run this code pattern. The steps are described in detail below.

## Prerequisite
- Operating Systems: Ubuntu Linux 14.04 / 16.04 LTS (both 64-bit), or Mac OS 10.12
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (Version 17.03 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)  (v5.x)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version 8.9 or higher - note version 9 is not supported)
  * to install specific Node version you can use [nvm](https://davidwalsh.name/nvm)
- [Hyperledger Composer](https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/installing/development-tools.html)
  * to install composer cli
    `npm install -g composer-cli`
  * to install composer-rest-server
    `npm install -g composer-rest-server`
  * to install generator-hyperledger-composer
    `npm install -g generator-hyperledger-composer`

## Steps
1. [Clone the repo](#1-clone-the-repo)
2. [Setup Fabric](#2-setup-fabric)
3. [Generate the Business Network Archive](#3-generate-the-business-network-archive)
4. [Deploy to Fabric](#4-deploy-to-fabric)
5. [Run Application](#5-run-application)

## 1. Clone the repo

Clone the this locally. In a terminal, run:

```
git clone git@github.com:hamxn/social-feedback.git
cd social-feedback
```

## 2. Setup Fabric

These commands will kill and remove all running containers, and should remove all previously created Hyperledger Fabric chaincode images:

```none
docker kill $(docker ps -q)
docker rm $(docker ps -aq)
docker rmi $(docker images dev-* -q)
```

All the scripts will be in the directory `/fabric-dev-servers`.  Start fabric and create peer admin card:

```
cd fabric-dev-servers/
./downloadFabric.sh
./startFabric.sh
./createPeerAdminCard.sh
```

## 3. Generate the Business Network Archive

Next generate the Business Network Archive (BNA) file from the root directory:

```
cd composer-server
composer archive create -t dir -n .
```

## 4. Deploy to Fabric

Now, we are ready to deploy the business network to Hyperledger Fabric. This requires the Hyperledger Composer chaincode to be installed on the peer,then the business network archive (.bna) must be sent to the peer, and a new participant, identity, and associated card must be created to be the network administrator. Finally, the network administrator business network card must be imported for use, and the network can then be pinged to check it is responding.

First, install the business network:

```
composer network install --card PeerAdmin@hlfv1 --archiveFile social-feedback.bna
```

Start the business network:

```
composer network start --networkName social-feedback --networkVersion 0.1.1 --networkAdmin admin --networkAdminEnrollSecret adminpw --card PeerAdmin@hlfv1 --file networkadmin.card
```

Import the network administrator identity as a usable business network card:

```
composer card import --file networkadmin.card
```

Check that the business network has been deployed successfully, run the following command to ping the network:
```
composer network ping --card admin@social-feedback
```

## 5. Run Application

To start the application:

```
 composer-rest-server -c admin@social-feedback -n never -w true -p3001
```

The REST server to communicate with network is available here:
`http://localhost:3000/explorer/`
